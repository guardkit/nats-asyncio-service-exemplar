"""Domain service — pure business logic, no NATS dependency.

PATTERN: Services contain all business logic. They:
- Accept typed Pydantic models as input
- Return typed Pydantic models as output
- Have NO dependency on NATS, FastStream, or broker
- Are independently testable without any infrastructure

This separation means you can unit test services without TestNatsBroker.
